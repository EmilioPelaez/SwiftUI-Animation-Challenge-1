# Challenge 1

Welcome to the SwiftUI Animation Challenge where we hand out animation challenges that everyone can participate in and solve.

This week's challenge is inspired by the Spotify now playing animation in its macOS app:

[Spotify animation](./now-playing.mp4)

## How does it work?

You can submit your video for this challenge until **Wednesday, July 27, 2022**. Submissions are done in form of Pull Requests (PRs) to this repository (Not sure how to do that? [We got you covered!](https://opensource.com/article/19/7/create-pull-request-github)). Create a folder with your project inside and give that folder a clear name (e.g. your name, so that we know whose solution it was).

When the deadline is there, [Amos](https://twitter.com/amos_gyamfi) and [Stefan](https://twitter.com/stefanjblos) will not only discuss the solutions by the community, but also reveal their solutions to the problem and give a walkthrough.

## Why?

Great question! We are both passionate about animations, SwiftUI, and the community. It's always fun to exchange ideas on how to solve certain challenges and if we can profit from each other's solutions it's a win-win-situation for everybody.

We benefit because we learn cool new tricks and solutions from the community and hope to give back the same. The community comes together and learns cool techniques how to improve their apps. Which even benefits end-users with better UX. See, it's great for all the people! :)
